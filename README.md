# CryptoClustering
Module 19, Unsupervised Machine Learning

## About
This project is intended to practice unsupervised machine learning to predict how cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24 hour and 7 day price changes. Python and Jupyter Notebook are utilized in cleaning data and accessing algorithms of unsupervised learning. A dataset of 42 different cryptocurrencies indicating percentages of price changes over 7 different time frames was utilized.

## Getting Started / Installation
To re-create this project, you will need to code in Python within a Jupyter Notebook file.  

You must import the following modules to clean your data with StandardScaler, properly analyze your data with Kmeans and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), as well as code in Pandas and plot your results.  

I also included an ignore warnings command to keep the code clearn, as there are a number of version change warnings populated from Python within this project. 

import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

## Summary
The crypto data from the csv was read into a Dataframe. This data was then scaled using the sklearn library with StandardScaler. That new scaled data was then placed into it's own Dataframe. Taking that dataframe, we plotted an Elbow Curve after looping through the data to test for the number of potential clusters up to 10. This graph indicates 4 is the correct value for K.

Next we ran the original data through the KMeans protocol with 4 clusters. We graphed those results in clusters and this is the result:

We then re-assessed our original data with the PCA protocol. After creating a new Dataframe from the PCA calcuations, we then plotted another Elbow Curve with this data to re-assess K value. Here is the graph, it also indicated that 4 is a good K value.

Finally, the PCA data was then run through the KMeans protocol and a final cluster map was created, still with 4 as the value of K. Here is the map.

Overall, both cluster graphs look similar with 2 more distinct clusters and then individual points making up the final 2 clusters. However, the PCA cluster graph has tighter circles of data within the 2 largest clusters. This indicates the PCA protocol can give you a better indication of what K value to use.

# CryptoClustering
Module 19, Unsupervised Machine Learning

## About
This project is intended to practice unsupervised machine learning to predict how cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24 hour and 7 day price changes. Python and Jupyter Notebook are utilized in cleaning data and accessing algorithms of unsupervised learning. A dataset of 42 different cryptocurrencies indicating percentages of price changes over 7 different time frames was utilized.

## Table of Contents
* Resources Folder
  * crypto_market_data.csv (file that holds our cryptocurrency data)
* Crypto_Clustering.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook file where code was written and processed)

## Getting Started / Installation
To re-create this project, you will need to code in Python within a Jupyter Notebook file.  

You must import the following modules to clean your data with StandardScaler, properly analyze your data with Kmeans and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), as well as code in Pandas and plot your results.  

I also included an ignore warnings command to keep the code clearn, as there are a number of version change warnings populated from Python within this project. 

import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

## Summary
The crypto data from the csv was read into a Dataframe. This data was then scaled using the sklearn library with StandardScaler. That new scaled data was then placed into it's own Dataframe. Taking that dataframe, we plotted an Elbow Curve after looping through the data to test for the number of potential clusters up to 10.
